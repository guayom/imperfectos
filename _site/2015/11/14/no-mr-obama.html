No, Mr. Obama, the attacks on France are not against humanity. They were against a specific people, with specific faces. It was against the French. Your words irresponsibly blur out the faces of those who truly suffer with a selfish political aim.
And I’m not going to fall for the lie: “all unite against the Muslims”. We lament the attacks and point at those who did it, but your sentence just wants the world to hate them, to kill them, to run around terrified and eliminate “the others”, which are also usually innocent.
Why did you not mention the attack on Beirut, which left tens of dead and which happened the same day as the ones in Paris? Do you not consider it an attack against humanity? Why did you not say that what happens in Syria when innocent people are being bombarded is a bombing against all humanity? Why are you not saying that the bombarding against Gaza, which killed thousands of innocent people, is an attack against humanity? Why are you not saying that the disappearance of 43 teacher trainees in Mexico is an abuse to all humanity? And what about Ukraine? What about the starvation in Africa? Wouldn’t you say that it is a starvation against all humanity? No, Mr. Obama, you are very wrong, all of humanity shouldn’t hate together. Your words provoke hate.
The words that should come out of the mouth of the holder of a Nobel Peace Prize should be words that lead us to peace and not to war. You, those who run the world, should show love towards Israel together with love towards Syria, Irak, Iran, Palestine, Europe, America, Africa… maybe something starts to change when you, those who run the world, start to change.
PS: I say Obama, but I could say “us”
