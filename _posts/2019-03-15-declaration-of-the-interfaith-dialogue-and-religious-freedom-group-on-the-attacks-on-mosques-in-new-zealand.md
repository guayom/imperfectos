\-That all people have the same right not to be the object of violence, persecution, discrimination and stigmatization.

\-That governments, parliaments, judiciaries and national human rights institutions must take urgent action in this regard.

\-That political, religious and community leaders, educators, the private sector, health professionals, civil society organizations and the media have an important role to play in education and prevention of acts of hate.

\-As religious leaders, representatives of 26 countries around the world, we strongly reject any act of Islamophobia, as well as reject any apology of hatred against Jewish, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists or any other religious or spiritual practice.

\-That in order to prevent discrimination and violence against any group of people, we must continue to investigate, prosecute and provide reparations to victims of acts of violence, torture and ill-treatment; reinforce measures to prevent and report such situations of violence; and incorporate persecution, discrimination and hatred with reasons of religious affiliation as aggravating circumstances in the laws against crimes motivated by hatred and against incitement to hatred.
